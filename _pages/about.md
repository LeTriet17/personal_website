I am an aspiring deep learning engineer pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the Ho Chi Minh University of Technology. With two years of hands-on experience, I have developed proficiency in various aspects of deep learning, including computer vision, time series forecasting, and evolutionary algorithms. My academic coursework has provided me with a strong theoretical foundation in machine learning concepts and techniques.

With a passion for continuous learning and creating solutions, I am looking forward to further developing my skills in deep learning methodologies and frameworks. My goal is to channel my enthusiasm for AI research and development into building innovative applications that can address real-world problems in ways that benefit people and society.
