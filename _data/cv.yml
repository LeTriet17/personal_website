    - title: REAL-TIME FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
      year: 04/2023 — 06/2023
      description:
        - The system detects faces in images/video streams, aligns them, and classifies emotional states using a pretrained model on a Jetson device
        - To optimize speed and throughput, the models were converted to TensorRT, and a Redis backend was implemented for fast data caching and retrieval. 
        - A backend API was built with FastAPI to provide inference services and a PyQT app was created for real-time visualization and analysis. The result is an efficient and accurate facial emotion analysis pipeline able to process streams of visual data in real-time at the edge. 

    - title: REAL-TIME PIG COUNTING SYSTEM FOR EDGE DEVICES 
      year: 05/2023 — 06/2023
      description:
        - Fine-tuned YOLOv8 object detector and segmentation on private dataset to accurately identify and localize pigs in images and video feeds.
        - Implemented object tracking to count pigs crossing designated areas and zones in the camera frame. 
        -  Converted models to TensorRT for optimized inference speed on Jetson hardware. Built a FastAPI backend service to provide real-time pig counts and analytics.

    - title: A FACIAL RECOGNITION AND FACE SEARCH SYSTEM 
      year: 06/2023 — 07/2023
      description:
        - The system detects faces in images using MTCNN and extracts face embeddings with FaceNet, a pretrained deep neural network. 
        - The embeddings are stored in a database, indexed using Faiss for efficient similarity search. New faces can be added to the database via the Python API. 
        - The project provides an end-to-end facial recognition pipeline enabling fast and accurate face search over large databases. 

    - title: VNPT TIME SERIES FORECASTING FOR NETWORK BEHAVIOR ANOMALY DETECTION
      year: 10/2022 — 03/2023
      description:
        - Preprocessed data and developed new features for experimental and model fine-tuning purposes.
        - Researched and built deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, RNNs) to predict non-routine tasks.
        - Currently publishing a paper named A Systematic CL-MLP Approach for Online Forecasting of Multiple Key Performance Indicators for The 2nd International Conference on Intelligence of Things 2023.

    - title: USING EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITGM FOR SCHEDULING
      year: 04/2022 — 01/2023
      description:
        - Applied NSGA-II Algorithm to determine the most optimal schedule for each team member in production planning
        - I have an upcoming publication titled "Multi-task and Multi-team Work Order Scheduling Using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II" the ICICT 2023 conference organized by Springer in London, United Kingdom.
